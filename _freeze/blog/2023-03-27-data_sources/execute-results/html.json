This blog post summarizes the first places I go when looking for a new dataset.\n\nWhile there are the big data repositories like Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning repository, and data.gov, I often find more useful datasets in the smaller, more curated repositories:\n\n\n# My favorite smaller, more curated repositories\n\n\n\n## Tidy Tuesday\n\n[![](img/data/tidy_tuesday.png){fig-alt='Tidy Tuesday logo'}](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday)\n\nLink: [https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday)\n\nTidy Tuesday is much more than \"just a data repository\". Tidy Tuesday is an entire community, originally brought together by [Tom Mock](https://themockup.blog/) to help people improve their data analysis and visualization skills using R. Tidy Tuesday provides weekly data sets and data exploration challenges, with thousands of participants from all around the world sharing their work, offering feedback, and collaborating on projects. Whether you are a seasoned data professional or just starting out, Tidy Tuesday is an excellent resource for learning and growth in the data science field.\n\n\n## Data is plural\n\n\n[![](img/data/data_is_plural.png){fig-alt='Data is plural homepage'}](https://www.data-is-plural.com/)\n\n\nLink: [https://www.data-is-plural.com/](https://www.data-is-plural.com/)\n\n\"*Data is Plural*\" is a weekly newsletter of \"useful/curious datasets\", published by [Jeremy Singer-Vine](https://www.jsvine.com/). The datasets on Data is Plural are delivered each week straight to your inbox and typically features a curated collection of recent and relevant high-quality and diverse datasets from a wide range of domains, including economics, sports, politics, science, and more.\n\n\n## FlowingData\n\n[![](img/data/flowing_data.png){fig-alt='Flowing data homepage'}](https://flowingdata.com/)\n\nLink: [https://flowingdata.com/](https://flowingdata.com/)\n\nWhile it is not technically a data repository, [Nathan Yau's](https://flowingdata.com/about) website [FlowingData](https://flowingdata.com/) contains a range of detailed visualizations and analyses of a range of interesting datasets, and he always provides a reference to the datasets that underlie his articles. Yau also offers a range of courses and tutorials for readers who are intersted in improving their data visualization and analysis skills\n\n## FiveThirtyEight\n\n[![](img/data/five_thirty_eight.jpg){fig-alt='FiveThirtyEight Logo'}](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data)\n\nLink: [https://data.fivethirtyeight.com/](https://data.fivethirtyeight.com/) (gihub repo: [https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data))\n\n[FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/), originally a blog created by Nate Silver, and now a large journalism site makes the data that underlies their data-driven articles available on github.  Since FiveThirtyEight's initial focus was political polls and elections (and I guess since Nate Silver is into sports), much of their data tends to be political and sports-related, but there are other data goodies to be found in their data repos too.\n\n## ProPublica\n\n[![](img/data/pro_publica.png){fig-alt='ProPublica Data Store homepage'}](https://www.propublica.org/datastore/)\n\nLink: [https://www.propublica.org/datastore/datasets](https://www.propublica.org/datastore/datasets)\n\nProPublica, offers a wide range of datasets for free (and even more for a premium membership fee). I honestly haven't used this resource much myself, but I've been aware of it, and it seems to have some fairly interesting datasets at first glance!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# The bigger, more obvious data repositories\n\nUnsurprisingly, when I asked chatGPT where I could find good sources of datasets, all of the following sources were included in its suggestions. However, I actually find myself choosing data from the more curated sources listed above more often.\n\n\n## Inbuilt datasets in R\n\n[![](img/data/r.png){fig-alt='The page displaying the list of datasets from the \"Datasets\" R package'}](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/00Index.html)\n\nLink: [https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/00Index.html](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/00Index.html)\n\nSometimes, when I need something quick-and-dirty, the inbuilt datasets in R will do the job! You can look at the list of datasets available in R by typing `data()` in R. The are also listed here: [https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/00Index.html](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/00Index.html)\n\nThere are also several packages that include several datasets when you load them, including ggplot2. You can look at the specific packages that are loaded with a package using the `package` argument in the `data()` function, for example:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata(package = \"ggplot2\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## UCI Machine Learning repository\n\n\nThe UCI Machine Learning repository is a public dataset repository maintained by the Machine Learning Group at the University of California, Irvine. The datasets are typically organized into the type of machine learning problem they can be used for, but they come from various domains, including biology, finance, social sciences, and engineering. If I'm being honest, the UCI Machine Learning repository is fairly old-school, and much of what you can find on UCI ML repository can also now be found on Kaggle.\n\n## Kaggle\n\nKaggle began as a machine learning competition platform, and by nature of machine learning competitions, kaggle has also ended up being a place that hosts a wide range of datasets (the datasets for all past challenges can be downloaded from the Kaggle Website).\n\n\n\n## Google Dataset Search\n\nGoogle Dataset Search is... well... Google but for datasets. As a search engine specifically designed for finding datasets, it can find you links to a wide range of datasets from various sources and domains, including research publications, government databases, and personal web pages. The search results can be filtered by keywords, format, and license type. My issue with Google Dataset Search, however, is that you basically already need to know what you're looking for in order to search for it. I'm usually going in blind, but this is a great resource for people looking for datasets on specific topics.\n\n\n## Amazon Web Services Public Datasets\n\n\nAmazon Web Services Public Datasets provides access to a large collection of public datasets that can be used for research and development projects. These datasets are hosted on the Amazon cloud infrastructure, and can be accessed using Amazon Web Services tools.\n\n\n\n## data.gov\n\ndata.gov is a government-owned online platform that provides public access to a vast collection of datasets from different federal agencies in the United States. data.gov hosts a wide range of datasets, including demographic data, weather data, environmental data, and economic data, among others. \n\n\n<!-- # Domain-specific datasets -->\n\n<!-- ## Ecology -->\n\n\n<!-- https://www.rforecology.com/post/top-five-ish-sources-of-ecological-data/ -->\n\n\n<!-- ## Healthcare -->\n\n<!-- CDC data -->\n<!-- https://data.cdc.gov/  -->\n\n<!-- NHANES data -->\n<!-- https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/Default.aspx -->\n\n\nIf you have some go-to resources for data, let me know by leaving a comment below!\n",
