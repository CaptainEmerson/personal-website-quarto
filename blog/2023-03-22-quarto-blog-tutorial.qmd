Phew! That was scary, but I did it. I deleted my old website and replaced it with this one. For a summary of *why* I converted my website from my old hugo-fuelled blogdown site to this seamless quarto site, check out my [previous post](https://www.rebeccabarter.com/blog/2023-03-21-quarto-website.html). This post summaries *how* I did the conversion.
