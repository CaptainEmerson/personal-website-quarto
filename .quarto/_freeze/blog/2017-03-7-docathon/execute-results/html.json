We have [loads of projects](https://bids.github.io/docathon/pages/projects/projects.html) signed up to receive some documentation-love and an impressive number of excited participants!\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](img/docathon/docathon.jpg-large){fig-align='center'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nWe kicked off the event with a series of tutorials for writing \"good\" documentation. I gave an R-specific tutorial where I discussed using devtools to both develop and document your package. I ended with a sneak peak into bookdown book-based documentation for complex packages. Skip ahead to 1:54:02 to hear my presentation! \n\n<center>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ikT_xnTFHC0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</center>\n\nThe materials for my tutorial can be found in this [github repo](https://github.com/rlbarter/R-documentation). Stay tuned for a more detailed blog post about writing documentation in R.\n",
