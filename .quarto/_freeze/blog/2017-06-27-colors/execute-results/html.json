It can be surprisingly difficult to decide on a palette that is both visually appealing and practical, but fortunately there do exist websites to help!\n\nFor example, [Coolors](https://coolors.co/704e2e-79745c-e6f8b2-cde77f-709176) shoots random, appealing, color palettes at you and you can swipe from one to the next with a hit of a space-bar.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](img/coolors/coolors.png){fig-align='center'}\n:::\n:::",
