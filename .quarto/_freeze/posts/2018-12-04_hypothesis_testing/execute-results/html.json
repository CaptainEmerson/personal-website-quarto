A flowchart\"\nauthor: \"Rebecca Barter\"\ncategories: [statistics, hypothesis testing]\noutput: \n  html: \n    toc: true\ndate: 2018-12-04\ndescription: \"A flowchart to decide what hypothesis test to use.\" \n---\n\n\nMany years ago I taught a stats class for which one of the topics was hypothesis testing. Many of the students had a hard time remembering what situation each test was designed for, so I made a flowchart to help piece together the wild world of hypothesis tests.\n\nWhile the flowchart isn't pretty (if I made it today, it would be much more attractive), I feel like it might be useful for others, so here it is:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](img/hypothesis_testing/Hypothesis_testing_flow_mean.png){fig-align='center'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n(if you all like it - I'll make a pretty version!)",
