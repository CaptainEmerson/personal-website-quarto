We have [loads of projects](https://bids.github.io/docathon/pages/projects/projects.html) signed up to receive some documentation-love and an impressive number of excited participants!\n\n\n```{r echo = FALSE, fig.align = \"center\"}\nknitr::include_graphics(\"img/docathon/docathon.jpg-large\")\n```\n\n\n\nWe kicked off the event with a series of tutorials for writing \"good\" documentation. I gave an R-specific tutorial where I discussed using devtools to both develop and document your package. I ended with a sneak peak into bookdown book-based documentation for complex packages. Skip ahead to 1:54:02 to hear my presentation! \n\n<center>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ikT_xnTFHC0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</center>\n\nThe materials for my tutorial can be found in this [github repo](https://github.com/rlbarter/R-documentation). Stay tuned for a more detailed blog post about writing documentation in R.\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"2017-03-7-docathon.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.280","theme":"flatly","title-block-banner":true,"title":"Docathon: A Week of Doumentation","author":"Rebecca Barter","categories":["documentation","R","communication"],"date":"2017-03-07","description":"We're hosting a week-long docathon over at BIDS.","toc-location":"left"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
